    === Project Setup

    First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
    You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
    but for now we'll just set up a default project.

    i  Using project weather-forecast-poc (weather-forecast-poc)

    === Hosting Setup

    Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
    will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
    have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

    ✔ What do you want to use as your public directory? dist/weather-forecast
    ✔ Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
    ✔ Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
    ✔ File dist/weather-forecast/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
    i  Skipping write of dist/weather-forecast/index.html
